**0x11. C - printf** 

This is a group project done by me and Shami5-Adel with the following **Tasks:**

`0. I'm not going anywhere. You can print that wherever you want to. I'm here and I'm a Spur for life`
This function produces output according to a format.

`1. Education is when you read the fine print. Experience is what you get if you don't`
This handles the conversions specifiers: `d, i`.

`2. With a face like mine, I do better in print`
This handles the custom conversion specifiers: `b: the unsigned int argumnet is converted to binary`.

`3. What one has not experienced, one will never understand in print`
This handles the following conversion specifiers: `u, o, x, X`

`4. Nothing in fine print is ever good news`
Use a local buffer of 1024 chars in order to call `write` as little as possible.

`5. My weakness is wearing too much leopard print`
This handles the custom conversion specifier: `S` that prints the string.

`6. How is the world ruled and led to war? Diplomats lie to journalists and believe these lies when they see them in print`
This handles the conversion specifier: `p`

`7. The big print gives and the small print takes away`
This handles the flag characters for non-custom conversion specifiers: `+, space, #`

`8. Sarcasm is lost in print`
This handles the  length modifiers for non-custom conversion specifiers: `l, h`, conversion specifiers to handle: `d, i, u, o, x, X`

`9. Print some money and give it to us for the rain forests`
This handle the field width for non-custom conversion specifiers.

`10. The negative is the equivalent of the composer's score, and the print the performance`
This handle the precision for non-custom conversion specifiers.

`11. It's depressing when you're still around and your albums are out of print`
This handle the 0 flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

`12. Every time that I wanted to give up, if I saw an interesting textile, print what ever, suddenly I would see a collection`
This handle the `-` flag character for non-custom conversion specifiers.

`13. Print is the sharpest and the strongest weapon of our party`
This handle the following custom conversion specifier: `r` that prints the reversed string

`14. The flood of print has turned reading into a process of gulping rather than savoring`
This handle the following custom conversion specifier: `R` that printsthe rot13'ed string

`15. *`
All the above options work well together.
